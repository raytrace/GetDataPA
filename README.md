Peer Assessment Assignment for coursera's Getting &amp; Cleaning Data

<br>

run_analysis.R reads in data from the standard UCI HAR dataset and assumes that all data is in the "data" subdirectory.

To run this script, set the working directory appropriately at the top of the script.

The script outputs a .txt file in CSV format (to allow uploading to the coursera website... it should really allow csv format) into the current working directory. This file contains summary measures for each subject-activity pair.
